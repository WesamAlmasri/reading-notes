# HTML and CSS

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. 

## Conclusions about Html

* HTML uses tags (elements) (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.

* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.

* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element and attributes require a name and a value.

* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs) and they also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

* There are three types of HTML lists: ordered (use numbers),
unordered (use bullets), and definition and lists can be nested inside one another.

* Links are created using the `<a>` element and use the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.

* The `<img>` element is used to add images to a web page and must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.

* The `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web page. Tabel is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the `<tr>` element. Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the `<td>` element (or `<th>` if it is a header). For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>` , `<tbody>` , and `<tfoot>`.

* Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a `<form>` element. Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using. You can add comments to your code between the `<!-- and -->` markers.

* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together. `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed. `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
