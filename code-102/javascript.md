# Javascript

JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.

## SCRIPT

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

## How to Write a script

* To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
  
* Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.

* Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.
  
## Expressions + Operators

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.

* Expressions that just assign a value to a variable. such as `var color = 'beige';`.
  
* Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value such as `var area = 3 * 2;`.

## OPERATORS

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

* ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS: Assign a value to a variable `color = 'beige';`.

* ARITHMETIC OPERATORS: Perform basic math `area = 3 * 2;`.

* STRING OPERATORS: Combine two strings `greeting= 'Hi ' + 'Mol ly';`.

* COMPARISON OPERATORS: Compare two values and return true or fa1se `buy = 3 > 5`.

* LOGICAL OPERATORS: Combine expressions and return true or fa1se `buy = (3 > 5) && (8 <1 0)`.
