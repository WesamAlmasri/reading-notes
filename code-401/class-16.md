## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information (or resources) to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.
2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

The server is a remote machine that receive request from a client and proccess it then send a response to the client
4. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

Deploying your application means putting it on a Web server so that it can be used either through the Internet or an intranet.

## Terms

**Server**: The server is a remote machine that receive request from a client and proccess it then send a response to the client

**Pub/Sub**: publish–subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are.

**WRRC**: The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers. Any computer making a request is a client and any computer sending a response is a server.

## Virtual Machines

In computing, a virtual machine is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination

## VMS and the Cloud 

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and other devices as a utility (like the electricity grid) over a network (typically the Internet). Clouds can be classified as public, private or hybrid. Cloud computing, or in simpler shorthand just “the cloud”, also focuses on maximizing the effectiveness of the shared resources. Cloud resources are usually not only shared by multiple users but are also dynamically reallocated per demand. This can work for allocating resources to users. For example, a cloud computer facility that serves European users during European business hours with a specific application (e.g., email) may reallocate the same resources to serve North American users during North America's business hours with a different application (e.g., a web server). This approach should maximize the use of computing power thus reducing environmental damage as well since less power, air conditioning, rack space, etc. are required for a variety of functions. With cloud computing, multiple users can access a single server to retrieve and update their data without purchasing licenses for different applications.

## AWS EC2

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable computer capacity in the cloud
- Designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers
- Allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction
- Provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon's proven computing environment
- EC2 offers the broadest and the deepest compute platform with a choice of processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model
- SLA commitment of 99.99% availability for each Amazon EC2 region, each region consists of at least 3 availability zones

## Elastic Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.
