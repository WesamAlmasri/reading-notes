## The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of

[The article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e) 

Regarding this article, the content was related to ethics because the company that the writer worked for was using the tech to cheat on their customers by displaying the same product each time and the customer thought that he will get the right product (medicine). And because of that one of the customer loosed his life.

I can conclude from this article that each programmer should have check for the work he is asked to do, if it is an ethic and what consequence and results that could bring because of his work.

## Self Driving Car Ethics

[The article](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2017/11/21/self-driving-cars-ethics/804805001/)

This article explained how the self driving car related to ethics and how it can be used for illegal or unethical behaviors, because any driving system that can be accessed remotely is actually can be hacked to and it could be used for doing crimes.

I can conclude from this article that the world and the governments should put a strict rules for companies that create and invent such systems to prevent unethical usage of this technologies.
